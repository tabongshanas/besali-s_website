                        <p> courage and authority as the deceased ruler. The burial of the  </p>
                        <p> chiefs or notable is carried out by the chiefs and notables in the  </p>
                        <p> land. It should be noted that different Mundani kingdoms exercise  </p>
                        <p> slightly different burial rites. For example, in Nkong, Bechati,  </p>
                        <p> Bangang, and Folipe the body of the Fouw is sat on a carefully  </p>
                        <p> designed cushion chair which is kept right inside the grave with  </p>
                        <p> two Ku-gang (crave status) on both sides of the corpse. This is the  </p>
                        <p> manner he usually sat on his throne in the palace. While in this  </p>
                        <p> position the body of the Fouw is wrapped with nchen before it is  </p>
                        <p> covered with the earth. </p>
                        <p> The Ku-gang symbolizes the departed servants who will continue  </p>
                        <p> to serve the departed ruler in the world of the dead. The two ku- </p>
                        <p> gangs equally represented a complete break with the past when,  </p>
                        <p> instead of these ku-gangs, Fouw was buried with live slaves or  </p>
                        <p> servants. </p>

                        <p> departure you told us who will sit on your throne pending your  </p>

                        <p> to cover the body with the earth. Once the burial is over,   </p>
                        <p> participants wash their hands and feet properly at lefem where </p>
                        <p> burial has to take place before leaving.  A series of rites are </p>
                        <p> performed in preparation for the kingmakers in Mundani. Within </p>
                        <p> this period of preparation, the kingmakers are high in high gear, </p>
                        <p> the chiefs, notables, as well as internal and external elites of the </p>

                        <p> tuh. On the enthronement, one of the Bekems informs all the </p>

                        <p> That morning the male and female children of the deceased ruler </p>
                        <p> are put in different rooms with the males in a separate room and </p>
                        <p> the females in another room. Bekems and those keeping the </p>
                        <p> willing will equally assemble in ntuo. There, they ensure that the </p>
                        <p> attire of the new chief to be enthroned as well as those of the </p>
                        <p> other members of his reigning council are intact and made </p>
                        <p> distinctly. More so, the sitting position of the new chief is prepared. </p>

                        <p>one of the kingmakers persistently blows a trumpet. Behind the </p>

                        <p>however wear breast wear over lelleng. Every participant bends </p>
                        <p>down in such a way that the head almost touches the knee. In this </p>
                        <p>mood, they move from lefem and pass across the ceremonial </p>
                        <p>ground to ntuoh inside the palace. Their movements are very slow </p>
                        <p>and the crowd keeps total silent as this process takes place. </p>
                        <p>At ntuoh Fouw is then dressed up in his traditional regalia and </p>
                        <p>brought with an entourage to the ceremonial group. To bring him </p>
                        <p>to the ceremonial group the leader of the kingmakers’ stands </p>
                        <p>ahead assisted with three or four other kingmakers. Next to the </p>
                        <p>Fouw is his Mafow. The Fouw holds a horsetail (asangleh) in his </p>
                        <p>hand and wears ndop on his neck. His Mafow wears a hat. Behind </p>
                        <p>them is a masked tuh, His Mafow wears a hat. Behind them is a </p>
                        <p>masked tuh, some chief tail the line. Then comes the pouring of </p>
                        <p>liberation in which the gods of the land are invoked to assist the </p>
                        <p>new ruler in his rule. The word of the initiation goes thus; </p>
                        <p> From today you are given the leopard knife to carry this land </p>
                        <p>(name of “Besali”) forward as your fathers had done. The gods </p>
                        <p>that created this land will guide and protect you to succeed in your </p>
                        <p>plans. Let your people listen to you and also listen to them. This </p>
                        <p>collaboration will enable you to rule like your father and friends of </p>
                        <p>other lands. We know that you are well prepared for the challenge </p>
                        <p>that lies in front of you. We equally know that you will neither fail </p>
                        <p>your people nor your friends.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing indicates that the performance contexts of Mundani </p>
                        <p>enthronement ceremonial are a chain of events that begins with </p>
                        <p>the suspected disappearance of the chief and moves up to the </p>
                        <p>official enthronement of a new chief. Numerous rites and public </p>
                        <p>ceremonies, therefore, characterize the presence of Mundani </p>
                        <p>enthronement with the new chief bringing the center actor or the </p>
                        <p>main protagonist of the events. He undertakes a ritual journey and </p>
                        <p>is finally entrusted into the hands of the kingmakers. Apart from </p>
                        <p>Mundani enthronement rites, the performance context of the </p>
                        <p>Mundani sacred societies also has a lot of significance in the </p>
                        <p>Mundani traditional society. Apart from tuh, other sacred societies </p>
                        <p>like ku-kang, ngweh, and lefem also affect the enthronement of a </p>
                        <p>chief in Mundani in one way or the other. The Mundani chiefs </p>
                        <p>greatly need these sacred societies to enable them to reign </p>
                        <p>successfully. They also need these societies to fight against </p>
                        <p>Witchcraft practices in their land. The chief needs ngweh to glorify </p>
                        <p>and appreciate those citizens that hardly show a lot of velour in the </p>
                        <p>land. With lefem, a chieftain is able to glorify and constantly </p>
                        <p>celebrate his royal title. During enthronement, lefem keeps Fouw </p>
